In just 2.5 hours, you'll learn to democratize data access and empower your organization with conversational analytics.

**What Makes This Workshop Unique:**
- **100% Hands-On**: Build a complete semantic model from scratch using real revenue data
- **Production-Ready**: Learn best practices and patterns used by enterprises
- **Flexible Learning**: Core sessions plus optional advanced topics
- **Immediate Value**: Start querying your own data with natural language by end of day

## What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you will have created:

✅ A complete **semantic model** for revenue analytics that supports natural language queries  
✅ **Custom metrics** and **verified queries** tailored to business needs  
✅ **Integration with Cortex Search** for fuzzy matching on high cardinality data (optional)  
✅ Understanding of how to deploy and scale Cortex Analyst in production

**You'll be able to answer questions like:**
- "What is the total revenue for electronics in December?"

### 📊 Session 1b: Advanced Fundamentals (45 minutes) - OPTIONAL
**Streamlit with Cortex Code & Dynamic Tables**

> **Optional Session:** This session introduces you to the revenue dataset, Cortex Code, and Dynamic Tables. Complete this before Session 2 to skip the environment setup, or go directly to Session 2.

Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard using Cortex Code and create automatic data pipelines with Dynamic Tables.

**What You'll Learn:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Create database, schema, and load revenue data
2. **Streamlit with Cortex Code**: Use AI to generate a complete dashboard
3. **Dynamic Tables**: Create automatic data transformation pipelines
4. **Real-time Updates**: Insert data and observe automatic refresh

**Key Takeaways:** 
- Cortex Code enables rapid development by translating natural language into working code
- Dynamic Tables keep derived data automatically up-to-date without manual ETL

### 🔍 Session 3: Cortex Search Integration with Cortex Analyst (15 minutes) - OPTIONAL
**Enhancing Analytics with Fuzzy Matching**

> **Optional Session:** This advanced topic demonstrates how to handle high cardinality columns with Cortex Search. Skip to Session 4 if you prefer to focus on core Cortex Analyst capabilities.

Cortex Search is a standalone service that can be integrated with Cortex Analyst to handle high cardinality columns such as product lines. Learn how this integration enables fuzzy matching that allows users to make mistakes with terminology and still get proper results.

**What You'll Learn:**
1. **The Problem**: Test queries that fail without exact terminology ("book" vs "Books")
2. **The Solution**: Create a Cortex Search service for product lines
3. **Integration**: Link the search service to your semantic model via Snowsight UI
4. **The Results**: Test fuzzy matching - "book and elec cat" → `IN ('Books', 'Electronics')`

**Key Takeaway:** Users no longer need to know exact values - Cortex Search handles variations, typos, and abbreviations automatically.
