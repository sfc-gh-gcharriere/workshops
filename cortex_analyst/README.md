## Overview

Transform your data analytics with **Snowflake Cortex Analyst** - the AI-powered solution that enables business users to ask questions in natural language and receive instant, accurate insights from their data.

This hands-on workshop takes you from Snowflake fundamentals through building production-ready semantic models, with optional advanced topics on search integration and intelligent automation. In just 2.5 hours, you'll learn to democratize data access and empower your organization with conversational analytics.

**What Makes This Workshop Unique:**
- **100% Hands-On**: Build a complete semantic model from scratch using real revenue data
- **Production-Ready**: Learn best practices and patterns used by enterprises
- **Flexible Learning**: Core sessions plus optional advanced topics
- **Immediate Value**: Start querying your own data with natural language by end of day

## What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you will have created:

‚úÖ A complete **semantic model** for revenue analytics that supports natural language queries  
‚úÖ **Custom metrics** and **verified queries** tailored to business needs  
‚úÖ **Integration with Cortex Search** for fuzzy matching on high cardinality data (optional)  
‚úÖ Understanding of how to deploy and scale Cortex Analyst in production

**You'll be able to answer questions like:**
- "What is the total revenue for electronics in December?"
- "Show me profit trends by region"
- "Which products have the highest margins?"
- "Compare actual vs forecasted revenue by month"

All using plain English - no SQL required for end users!

### üîç Session 3: Cortex Search Integration with Cortex Analyst (15 minutes) - OPTIONAL
**Enhancing Analytics with Fuzzy Matching**

> **Optional Session:** This advanced topic demonstrates how to handle high cardinality columns with Cortex Search. Skip to Session 4 if you prefer to focus on core Cortex Analyst capabilities.

Cortex Search is a standalone service that can be integrated with Cortex Analyst to handle high cardinality columns such as product lines. Learn how this integration enables fuzzy matching that allows users to make mistakes with terminology and still get proper results.

**What You'll Learn:**
1. **The Problem**: Test queries that fail without exact terminology ("book" vs "Books")
2. **The Solution**: Create a Cortex Search service for product lines
3. **Integration**: Link the search service to your semantic model via Snowsight UI
4. **The Results**: Test fuzzy matching - "book and elec cat" ‚Üí `IN ('Books', 'Electronics')`

**Key Takeaway:** Users no longer need to know exact values - Cortex Search handles variations, typos, and abbreviations automatically.
