## What is Cortex Search?

**Cortex Search** is a standalone, fully managed search service in Snowflake that can be integrated with Cortex Analyst to handle **high cardinality columns** such as product lines, customer names, or geographic locations.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Semantic Search**: Find content by meaning, not just exact keywords
- **Vector Embeddings**: Automatically generated using Snowflake's AI models
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Match variations, typos, and abbreviations to actual values

**Why Integrate with Cortex Analyst?**
When users ask questions, they often use informal language or partial terms (e.g., "book" instead of "Books", "elec" instead of "Electronics"). Cortex Search enables fuzzy matching that allows users to make mistakes with terminology and still get proper results.

## Part 1: Understanding the Problem

### Step 1: Test a Question That Works

Let's start by asking a question about product lines using natural language:

**Question 1: Works ✅**
> "Sales revenue for product line having clothes"

In the Cortex Analyst Playground, enter this question and run it.

**Why This Works:**
- Your semantic model has sample values that include "Clothing"
- Cortex Analyst can match "clothes" to "Clothing" from the discovered samples
- Query generates: `WHERE product_line = 'Clothing'`

**💡 Where to Find Sample Values:**
To see what sample values Cortex Analyst has discovered:
1. Navigate to your **REVENUE_TIMESERIES** semantic view
2. Select the **PRODUCT_DIM** table
3. Find the **PRODUCT_LINE** dimension
4. Click **Edit Dimension**
5. Scroll to the **Sample Values** section

You'll see values like "Clothing", "Electronics", "Books" that Cortex Analyst uses for matching.

---

### Step 2: Test a Question That Fails

Now let's try a similar question with different terminology:

**Question 2: Fails ❌**
> "Sales revenue in book product lines"

In the Cortex Analyst Playground, enter this question and run it.

**Why This Fails:**
- The semantic model samples don't include "Books" as a value
- Cortex Analyst cannot match "book" to any known product line
- Result: Error or "No data found" message

**The Problem:**
Users need to know the exact terminology in your data. If they say "book" instead of "Books", or "elec" instead of "Electronics", queries may fail. This creates a poor user experience.

## Part 2: Cortex Search Solution (10 minutes)

### Step 3: Create Cortex Search Service for Product Lines

Now let's create a Cortex Search service to enable fuzzy/semantic matching on product lines:

```sql
USE SCHEMA CORTEX_ANALYST_DEMO.REVENUE_TIMESERIES;
USE WAREHOUSE cortex_analyst_wh;

-- Create search service on product lines
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE product_line_search_service
  ON product_dimension
  WAREHOUSE = cortex_analyst_wh
  TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
  AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_line AS product_dimension 
    FROM product_dim
  );
```

**What This Does:**
- **Indexes all unique product lines** from your `PRODUCT_DIM` table
- **Creates vector embeddings** that understand semantic similarity
- **Enables fuzzy matching** so "book" matches "Books", "elec" matches "Electronics"
- **Updates automatically** within 1 hour when new product lines are added

**Search Service Parameters:**
- **ON product_dimension**: The column to vectorize and search
- **WAREHOUSE**: Compute resources for indexing and search
- **TARGET_LAG**: Maximum time before new data appears in search (1 hour)
- **AS (SELECT ...)**: The data source query

**Verify the Search Service:**

To verify your search service was created successfully:
1. Navigate to **AI & ML** > **Cortex Search** in Snowsight
2. You should see `PRODUCT_LINE_SEARCH_SERVICE` listed
3. Click on the service to view its details and status

<img width="1258" height="204" alt="cortex_search_ui" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b742c73-00a3-403d-98db-943f082153be" />

**Optional: Test the Search Service Directly**

You can test the search service with SQL to see how it matches terms:

```sql
-- Test the search service directly
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
  product_line_search_service!SEARCH(
    'book',
    LIMIT => 5
  )
);
```

**Expected Results:**
- `product_dimension`: "Books"
- `search_score`: Relevance score (e.g., 0.95)

The search service found "Books" even though we searched for "book"!

---

### Step 4: Integrate Search Service with Semantic Model

Now we need to tell Cortex Analyst to use this search service when users ask about product lines.

#### Option A: Update Semantic Model YAML (Manual)

If you're editing the YAML file directly, add this to your semantic model:

```yaml
# Add to your semantic model configuration
tables:
  - name: PRODUCT_DIM
    base_table:
      database: CORTEX_ANALYST_DEMO
      schema: REVENUE_TIMESERIES
      table: PRODUCT_DIM
    dimensions:
      - name: PRODUCT_LINE
        synonyms:
          - product category
          - product type
          - product line
        description: The product category (e.g., Books, Electronics, Clothing)
        expr: PRODUCT_LINE
        data_type: TEXT
        cortex_search_service: product_line_search_service  # Enable search!
```

#### Option B: Update via Snowsight UI (Recommended)

1. Navigate to your **REVENUE_TIMESERIES** semantic view in Snowsight
2. Click **Edit**
3. Select the **PRODUCT_DIM** table
4. Find the **PRODUCT_LINE** dimension
5. Enable **Cortex Search** and select `product_line_search_service`
6. Click **Save**

---

### Step 5: Test With Fuzzy Matching

Now let's test the same question that failed before, plus a more complex one:

**Question 3: Now Works! ✅**
> "Sales revenue in book product lines"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cortex Search matches "book" → "Books" using vector similarity
- Query generates: `WHERE product_line = 'Books'`
- Returns revenue data successfully!

**Question 4: Advanced Test ✅**
> "Overall sales revenue in book and elec cat"

**Expected SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM cortex_analyst_demo.revenue_timeseries.daily_revenue dr
JOIN cortex_analyst_demo.revenue_timeseries.product_dim pd 
    ON dr.product_id = pd.product_id
WHERE pd.product_line IN ('Books', 'Electronics')
```

**Key Observations:**
- ✅ "book" was matched to "Books"
- ✅ "elec cat" was matched to "Electronics"
- ✅ Uses `IN ('Books', 'Electronics')` - **NOT** `LIKE '%book%'`
- ✅ Vector search finds the actual product line names!
- ✅ No need for wildcards or partial matching

---

## The Value of Cortex Search

### Without Cortex Search ❌
- Users must know exact values: "Books", "Electronics", "Clothing"
- Queries fail with variations: "book", "elec", "clothes"
- Poor user experience, frustrated users
- Requires data catalog knowledge

### With Cortex Search ✅
- Users can use natural language: "book", "electronics", "clothes"
- Handles typos and abbreviations: "elec", "cloths", "electornic"
- Semantic understanding: "apparel" → "Clothing"
- Forgiving and intuitive
- **Allows users to make mistakes and still get proper results!**

---

## Additional Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Location/Region Search

Create a search service for regions and states:

```sql
-- Create search service for regions
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE region_search_service
  ON region_dimension
  WAREHOUSE = cortex_analyst_wh
  TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
  AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT sales_region AS region_dimension 
    FROM location_dim
  );

-- Create search service for states
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE state_search_service
  ON state_dimension
  WAREHOUSE = cortex_analyst_wh
  TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
  AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT state AS state_dimension 
    FROM location_dim
  );
```

**Benefits:**
- "Show revenue in the midwest" → Matches to actual region names
- "Sales in NY" → Matches "New York"
- "California or Texas" → Matches both states correctly

---

### Use Case 2: Customer Segment/Industry Search

If you have customer segments or industry classifications:

```sql
-- Example: Search service for customer segments
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE segment_search_service
  ON segment_dimension
  WAREHOUSE = cortex_analyst_wh
  TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
  AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_segment AS segment_dimension 
    FROM your_customer_table
  );
```

**Enables Questions Like:**
- "Revenue from enterprise clients" → Matches "Enterprise"
- "Sales to schools" → Matches "Education"
- "B2B revenue" → Matches "Business" or "Corporate"

---

## Best Practices

### 1. When to Use Cortex Search
✅ **Use for:**
- Categorical dimensions with many distinct values
- Fields where users might use variations/synonyms
- Industry-specific terminology
- Geographic locations
- Product catalogs

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Numeric values (use regular filters)
- Date ranges (use time dimensions)
- Boolean fields (true/false)
- Small, well-known value sets (e.g., Yes/No)

### 2. Search Service Configuration
- **TARGET_LAG**: 
  - Use `'1 minute'` for rapidly changing data
  - Use `'1 hour'` or `'1 day'` for stable dimensions
  - Shorter lag = more compute cost
  
- **Warehouse Sizing**:
  - Start with SMALL for < 1M rows
  - Scale up for larger datasets or faster refresh needs

### 3. Semantic Model Integration
- Enable Cortex Search on key dimensions users will query
- Don't over-index - focus on high-value fields
- Test with common variations and typos
- Monitor query performance

## Common Questions

**Q: Does Cortex Search slow down queries?**  
A: No! Search happens during query generation, not execution. The actual SQL uses exact matches (IN clause), so query performance is identical.

**Q: How much does Cortex Search cost?**  
A: Minimal cost - just the warehouse time to build/refresh the index. Query-time search is very fast and efficient.

**Q: Can I use multiple search services in one query?**  
A: Yes! Enable search on multiple dimensions (product lines, regions, states, etc.) and Cortex Analyst will use them appropriately.

**Q: What if the search can't find a match?**  
A: Cortex Analyst will either ask for clarification or return no results, just like without search. The difference is search has a much higher success rate.

**Q: Can I customize the matching algorithm?**  
A: The vector embeddings are automatic, but you can control results by adding synonyms to your semantic model dimensions.
