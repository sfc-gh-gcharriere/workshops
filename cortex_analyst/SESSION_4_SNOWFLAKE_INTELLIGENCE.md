**Key Capabilities:**
- **Conversational Analytics**: Ask questions across all your data using natural language
- **Intelligent Tool Orchestration**: Automatically selects and chains the right AI services (Cortex Analyst, Cortex Search, etc.)
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation context and learns from your interactions
- **Platform Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your semantic models, data, and Snowflake features

**How It Works:**
1. You interact with Snowflake Intelligence through a chat interface in Snowsight
2. Ask questions or request actions in natural language
3. Intelligence analyzes your request and determines the best tools to use
4. Orchestrates multiple Snowflake services as needed (Cortex Analyst for data queries, Cortex Search for semantic search, etc.)
5. Returns comprehensive answers with context and explanations
6. Maintains conversation history for follow-up questions

**What Makes It Different:**
- **Beyond Cortex Analyst**: While Cortex Analyst focuses on structured data queries, Snowflake Intelligence can help with platform tasks, documentation, troubleshooting, and more
- **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: Automatically combines different AI services based on your needs
- **Unified Experience**: One interface for all your Snowflake AI capabilities

In this session, you'll explore how Snowflake Intelligence and Agents extend your Cortex Analyst capabilities to create sophisticated, automated analytics workflows.

## Part 1: Snowflake Agents (10 minutes)

### What are Snowflake Agents?

Snowflake Agents are AI-powered assistants that can:
- **Orchestrate Multiple Tools**: Combine Cortex Analyst with other capabilities
- **Chain Actions**: Execute multi-step workflows automatically
- **Integrate External Systems**: Connect to APIs, send notifications, trigger actions
- **Learn from Context**: Understand user intent and adapt responses

Think of agents as intelligent coordinators that can analyze data, make decisions, and take actionâ€”all through natural language.

---

### Setup Snowflake Intelligence

Before creating agents, you need to set up the required database and schema structure. Run the following SQL commands:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- 1. Create database for Snowflake Intelligence configuration
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS snowflake_intelligence;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE snowflake_intelligence TO ROLE PUBLIC;

-- 2. Create schema to store agents
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS snowflake_intelligence.agents;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA snowflake_intelligence.agents TO ROLE PUBLIC;

-- 3. Grant CREATE AGENT privilege to your role
GRANT CREATE AGENT ON SCHEMA snowflake_intelligence.agents TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- 4. Set default role and warehouse for your user (required for Snowflake Intelligence)
ALTER USER admin SET DEFAULT_ROLE = ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER USER admin SET DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = cortex_analyst_wh;
```

**What This Does:**
- Creates a dedicated `snowflake_intelligence` database for agent configuration
- Creates an `agents` schema to store all agent definitions
- Grants appropriate privileges for agent creation and access
- Makes agents discoverable to all users with PUBLIC role
- Sets your default role and warehouse (required for Snowflake Intelligence to work)

**Important Notes:**
- By default, Snowflake Intelligence uses the user's default role and default warehouse
- All queries from Snowflake Intelligence use the user's credentials
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and data masking policies automatically apply to all agent interactions

For more details, see the [Snowflake Intelligence documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/snowflake-intelligence).

### Create Your First AI Agent

Navigate to **AI & ML** > **Agents** in Snowsight and click **+ Agent** to create your first AI agent.

<img alt="create_agent" src="img/snowflake_intelligence/create_agent.png" />

**Agent Configuration:**

1. **Agent object name**: `revenue_analyst_agent`
2. **Display name**: `Revenue Analyst Agent`
3. **Warehouse**: Select `cortex_analyst_wh` (compute resources for agent operations)
4. **Description**: `AI agent for analyzing revenue data and answering business questions`
5. **Instructions**: System prompts to guide agent behavior:
   ```
   You are a helpful revenue data analyst. Use the Cortex Analyst tool to answer 
   questions about revenue, products, and regional performance. Provide clear, 
   concise answers with relevant data insights.
   ```

Click **Create agent** to complete the initial setup

---

### Step 2: Add Cortex Analyst Tool to Agent

Integrate your semantic model as a tool the agent can use:

```sql
ALTER AGENT revenue_analyst_agent
  ADD TOOL cortex_analyst_tool
  TYPE = CORTEX_ANALYST
  PARAMETERS = (
    SEMANTIC_MODEL = '@cortex_analyst_demo.revenue_timeseries.raw_data/revenue_timeseries.yaml'
  )
  DESCRIPTION = 'Query revenue, product, and regional data using natural language';
```

**Tool Configuration:**
- **Type**: CORTEX_ANALYST indicates this tool uses your semantic model
- **Parameters**: Points to your semantic model YAML file
- **Description**: Helps the agent understand when to use this tool

---

### Step 3: Add Custom Email Tool

Create a tool that can send email notifications with analysis results:

```sql
-- First, create a Python UDF for sending emails
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION send_email_notification(
    recipient STRING,
    subject STRING,
    body STRING
)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE PYTHON
RUNTIME_VERSION = '3.11'
HANDLER = 'send_email'
PACKAGES = ('snowflake-snowpark-python')
AS
$$
def send_email(recipient, subject, body):
    # In production, integrate with your email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
    # For demo purposes, we'll return a confirmation message
    confirmation = f"Email sent to {recipient}\nSubject: {subject}\nBody: {body}"
    return confirmation
$$;

-- Add email tool to agent
ALTER AGENT revenue_analyst_agent
  ADD TOOL email_notification_tool
  TYPE = FUNCTION
  PARAMETERS = (
    FUNCTION_NAME = 'send_email_notification',
    DESCRIPTION = 'Send email notifications with analysis results'
  )
  DESCRIPTION = 'Use this tool when the user requests to send or share analysis results via email';
```

**Custom Tool Types:**
- **FUNCTION**: Python/Java UDFs
- **PROCEDURE**: Stored procedures
- **EXTERNAL_FUNCTION**: API integrations
- **CORTEX_ANALYST**: Semantic model queries

---

### Step 4: Test Your Agent

#### Simple Query
```sql
-- Test basic data query
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.AGENT_CHAT(
  'revenue_analyst_agent',
  'What was the total revenue in December 2023?'
);
```

#### Multi-Tool Orchestration
```sql
-- Test tool chaining
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.AGENT_CHAT(
  'revenue_analyst_agent',
  'Analyze revenue by product line for Q4 2023 and email the results to sales-team@company.com'
);
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Agent analyzes the question
2. Uses Cortex Analyst tool to query revenue data
3. Formats the results
4. Uses email tool to send notification
5. Returns confirmation to user

---

### Step 5: Advanced Agent Patterns

#### Conditional Logic
```sql
ALTER AGENT revenue_analyst_agent
  SET INSTRUCTIONS = $$
    You are a revenue analyst assistant.
    
    When analyzing revenue data:
    - If revenue < $10,000, flag as "low performance"
    - If revenue > $100,000, flag as "high performance"
    - Always include comparisons to previous periods
    
    When sending emails:
    - For executives, provide high-level summaries
    - For analysts, include detailed breakdowns
    - Always include data visualization recommendations
  $$;
```

#### Error Handling
```sql
ALTER AGENT revenue_analyst_agent
  SET INSTRUCTIONS = $$
    If Cortex Analyst returns no data:
    - Suggest alternative date ranges or filters
    - Check if the question needs clarification
    
    If a tool fails:
    - Inform the user clearly
    - Suggest alternative approaches
    - Don't make up data
  $$;
```
