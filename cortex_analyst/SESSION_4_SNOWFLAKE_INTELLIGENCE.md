# Session 4: Snowflake Intelligence (30 minutes)

## What is Snowflake Intelligence?

**Snowflake Intelligence** is Snowflake's AI-powered assistant that provides a unified, conversational interface to interact with your entire Snowflake environment. It combines natural language understanding with intelligent tool orchestration to help users get insights, automate workflows, and manage their data platform.

<img alt="cortex_analyst" src="img/snowflake_intelligence/snowflake_intelligence.png" />

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Conversational Analytics**: Ask questions across all your data using natural language
- **Intelligent Tool Orchestration**: Automatically selects and chains the right AI services (Cortex Analyst, Cortex Search, etc.)
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation context and learns from your interactions
- **Platform Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your semantic models, data, and Snowflake features

**How It Works:**
1. You interact with Snowflake Intelligence through a chat interface in Snowsight
2. Ask questions or request actions in natural language
3. Intelligence analyzes your request and determines the best tools to use
4. Orchestrates multiple Snowflake services as needed (Cortex Analyst for data queries, Cortex Search for semantic search, etc.)
5. Returns comprehensive answers with context and explanations
6. Maintains conversation history for follow-up questions

**What Makes It Different:**
- **Beyond Cortex Analyst**: While Cortex Analyst focuses on structured data queries, Snowflake Intelligence can help with platform tasks, documentation, troubleshooting, and more
- **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: Automatically combines different AI services based on your needs
- **Unified Experience**: One interface for all your Snowflake AI capabilities

In this session, you'll explore how Snowflake Intelligence and Agents extend your Cortex Analyst capabilities to create sophisticated, automated analytics workflows.

## Snowflake Agents

### What are Snowflake Agents?

Snowflake Agents are AI-powered assistants that can:
- **Orchestrate Multiple Tools**: Combine Cortex Analyst with other capabilities
- **Chain Actions**: Execute multi-step workflows automatically
- **Integrate External Systems**: Connect to APIs, send notifications, trigger actions
- **Learn from Context**: Understand user intent and adapt responses

Think of agents as intelligent coordinators that can analyze data, make decisions, and take actionâ€”all through natural language.

---

### Setup Snowflake Intelligence

Before creating agents, you need to set up the required database and schema structure. Run the following SQL commands:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- 1. Create database for Snowflake Intelligence configuration
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS snowflake_intelligence;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE snowflake_intelligence TO ROLE PUBLIC;

-- 2. Create schema to store agents
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS snowflake_intelligence.agents;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA snowflake_intelligence.agents TO ROLE PUBLIC;

-- 3. Grant CREATE AGENT privilege to your role
GRANT CREATE AGENT ON SCHEMA snowflake_intelligence.agents TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- 4. Set default role and warehouse for your user (required for Snowflake Intelligence)
ALTER USER admin SET DEFAULT_ROLE = ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER USER admin SET DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = cortex_analyst_wh;

-- 5. Enable cross-region inference (required for Snowflake Intelligence)
ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION = 'ANY_REGION';
```

**What This Does:**
- Creates a dedicated `snowflake_intelligence` database for agent configuration
- Creates an `agents` schema to store all agent definitions
- Grants appropriate privileges for agent creation and access
- Makes agents discoverable to all users with PUBLIC role
- Sets your default role and warehouse (required for Snowflake Intelligence to work)
- Enables cross-region inference to allow Cortex AI features to work across regions

**Important Notes:**
- By default, Snowflake Intelligence uses the user's default role and default warehouse
- All queries from Snowflake Intelligence use the user's credentials
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and data masking policies automatically apply to all agent interactions

For more details, see the [Snowflake Intelligence documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/snowflake-intelligence).

These capabilities make it easy for business users to explore and analyze data without writing SQL or understanding complex technical details.

---

### Example Questions for Snowflake Intelligence

Now that your agent is configured with the semantic model, you can ask business questions through Snowflake Intelligence. Try these examples:

1. What was the total revenue in 2024?
2. Compare revenue across all regions
3. Top 5 products by revenue
4. Monthly revenue trend for 2024
5. Monthly profit in Europe per category
6. List large orders from last month
7. YoY revenue growth by product line
8. Which region had the highest growth in 2024?

**Follow-up Questions:**
After asking a question, try follow-ups like "Show me the trend over time" or "Compare that to the previous year". Snowflake Intelligence will remember the context and understand what "that" refers to!

### Add Custom Email Tool (Optional)

Extend your agent's capabilities by adding email functionality. This allows the agent to send analysis results directly via email.

**Step 1: Setup Email Integration**

First, set up the email notification integration in the agents schema:

```sql
-- ========================================
-- Email integration setup
-- ========================================
-- Switch to the agents schema
USE SCHEMA snowflake_intelligence.agents;

-- Create a notification integration for sending emails
-- This allows Snowflake to send emails through its built-in email service
CREATE OR REPLACE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION snowflake_intelligence_email_integration
  TYPE=EMAIL
  ENABLED=TRUE
  DEFAULT_SUBJECT = 'Snowflake Cortex Demo';
```

**Step 2: Create Email Sending Procedure**

Create a stored procedure that wraps Snowflake's email sending functionality:

```sql
-- ========================================
-- Email sending procedure
-- ========================================
-- Create a stored procedure that wraps Snowflake's email sending functionality
-- This makes it easier for agents and applications to send emails
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE send_email(
    recipient_email VARCHAR,    -- Email address of the recipient
    subject VARCHAR,            -- Email subject line
    body VARCHAR                -- Email body content
)
RETURNS VARCHAR
LANGUAGE PYTHON
RUNTIME_VERSION = '3.12'
PACKAGES = ('snowflake-snowpark-python')
HANDLER = 'send_email'
AS
$$
def send_email(session, recipient_email, subject, body):
    """
    Send an email using Snowflake's built-in email integration.

    Args:
        session: Snowpark session object
        recipient_email: Email address to send to
        subject: Email subject line
        body: Email body content

    Returns:
        Success or error message
    """
    try:
        # Escape single quotes in the body to prevent SQL injection
        escaped_body = body.replace("'", "''")

        # Execute the system procedure call to send the email
        session.sql(f"""
            CALL SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL(
                'snowflake_intelligence_email_integration', -- Name of the notification integration
                '{recipient_email}',             -- Recipient email address
                '{subject}',                     -- Email subject
                '{escaped_body}'                 -- Email body (escaped)
            )
        """).collect()

        return "Email sent successfully"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error sending email: {str(e)}"
$$;
```

**Step 3: Add Email Tool to Your Agent**

Now integrate the email procedure with your agent:

```sql
ALTER AGENT revenue_analyst_agent
  ADD TOOL email_notification_tool
  TYPE = PROCEDURE
  PARAMETERS = (
    PROCEDURE_NAME = 'tools.send_email',
    DESCRIPTION = 'Send email notifications with analysis results'
  )
  DESCRIPTION = 'Use this tool when the user requests to send or share analysis results via email';
```

**Custom Tool Types:**
- **FUNCTION**: Python/Java UDFs
- **PROCEDURE**: Stored procedures
- **EXTERNAL_FUNCTION**: API integrations
- **CORTEX_ANALYST**: Semantic model queries
